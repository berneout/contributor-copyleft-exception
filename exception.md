# Contributor Copyleft Exception {{{version}}}

Contributors to this software project are exempt from the copyleft rules of its public license for versioned releases to which they contributed.  An individual or legal entity qualifies as a contributor of a specific, versioned release of this software if they, or someone working for them, did any of these:

1.  contributed source code, documentation, or other written work to that release

2.  contributed written work to another release made after that release

3.  contributed written work to another release made during the six calendar months before publication of that release

4.  donated at least {{{donation minimum}}} to contributors via {{{donation url}}}, either after that release or during the twelve calendar months before publication of that release

In other words, collaborators and donors are exempt for all old releases, as well as new releases within the six calendar months after their last contribution.

The purpose of this exception is to encourage ongoing contribution to this software and monetary support of those contributing.
